# 🪩 Diamonds

Diamonds is a lightweight CLI utility that allows you to **manage** and **copy** URLs and color codesfor your projects from anywhere in your Terminal.

I've always found it exhausting to clutter my browser with bookmarks for URLs I need to access frequently, and I had been using a bash script to allow me to easily copy URLs from a markdown file. However, after seeing my Mutlimedia Design baddie girlfriend scrambling back and forth between apps and even physical notes to copy the color codes for her projects, I decided it was time to create a little CLI tool that could make our day-to-day work friendlier (and prettier!)


And so was Diamonds born! A little gift to my girlfriend and, hopefully, a succesfull hint 😉💍
